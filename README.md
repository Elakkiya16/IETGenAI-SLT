# Generative AI for Sign Language Translation ‚Äì Supplementary Code

This repository contains the complete supplementary material for the book **‚ÄúGenerative AI for Sign Language Translation‚Äù**, including chapter-wise implementations, code explanations, and result visualizations. The content spans preprocessing, embedding techniques, generative modeling, video synthesis, and evaluation pipelines for Sign Language Translation (SLT).

## üìò Overview

Each chapter provides runnable Jupyter Notebooks, organized by section and aligned with the corresponding book content. The repository includes:

- Sentence-to-gloss and speech-to-gloss translation pipelines  
- Preprocessing and augmentation for sign language datasets  
- Transformer, diffusion, and multimodal generation techniques  
- Pose keypoint extraction and visualization using MediaPipe  
- Quantitative evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, SSIM, PSNR, WER  
- Skeleton-based motion modeling and synthetic video synthesis
